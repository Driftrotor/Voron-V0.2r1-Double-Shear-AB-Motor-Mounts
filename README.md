# Voron V0.2r1 Double Shear AB Motor Mounts

This mod was born out of wanting to really make the motion system as robust as possible and to remove as much free play as possible.
After working on the PIN mods to tighten up the free play with the bearing stacks i concentrated on making the Motors work more efficiently.
Double Shear was the way to go forwards with this as it removes a huge amount of stress from the motor shaft.

This is V1 of such a mod and after testing for over a month now with good results.

motors run cooler, even with the same current values

belt tension can be increased to remove backlash from the belts

typically higher motion performance can be realized, even with 24v

after installation of this mod you will need to re-tune your slicer settings as the motion system has less *slop* in it.
